I have used the numpy random generator as of now but added the logic to bias the output. I have also added the screenshots. Once the distribution is plotted multiple time a bell curve peaked around 73 will be formed. If the question is to have an absolute prob(which is I guess not logical) then I can compare the ratio with 73/27 with each new number. But the current solution solves the probabilty problem very well. I am writing the generator will revert back soon.
